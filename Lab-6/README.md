**Question:**
Use one of following editor (only) to keyin your programs: jed,  xjed, vim, gvim, emacs, xemacs.
1 (a). Implement linear time selection algorithm. And use it to find the median.  40
(b) Compare running time for random integers with faster of Merge/Heap sort for: 10
N=10,100,1000,10000,100 000 (1 lakh), 100 00 00 (1 Million).
Please stop running a program as soon as running time for that program exceeds 3 minutes.
2 (a). Implement Strassen's Algorithm to multiply two  2^k√ó2^k  matrices. 20
(b) Compare running time with the usual method for multiplying two matrices (using random integers
in range 0..99) for k=4,7,9,11, 13, 15, 17 5
Please stop running a program as soon as running time for that program exceeds 3 minutes.
