### Recursive Algorithms for Sorting ###
**Question:**
Use one of following editor (only) to keyin your programs: jed,  xjed, vim, gvim, emacs, xemacs.
All questions are of equal weightage.
1. Implement recursive quick sort, pivot is to be chosen at random.
2. Implement recursive merge sort. You are may use merge procedure (to merge two sorted arrays) of a previous lab.
3. Use time command to find running time for above programs and also non-recursive merge sort (of previous lab) for
N=10,100,1000,10000,100 000 (1 lakh), 100 00 00 (1 Million).
