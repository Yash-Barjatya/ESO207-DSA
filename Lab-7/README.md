**Question:**
Use one of following editor (only) to keyin your programs: jed,  xjed, vim, gvim, emacs, xemacs.
1. Implement O(n2) time algorithm for closest pair: find distances between each pair of points and return the one having minimum distance. 10
2. Implement O(nlog n) time algorithm for closest pair. You may resuse sorting routine(s) of earlier lab(s). 50
3.Compare running time of above programs for 10,100,5000,25000,50000 pairs. 15
Please stop running a program as soon as running time for that program exceeds 3 minutes.
