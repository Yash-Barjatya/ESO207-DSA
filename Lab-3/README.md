### Sorting I ###
**Question:**
Use one of following editor (only) to keyin your programs: jed,  xjed, vi, vim, gvim, emacs, xemacs
In this lab you are Not allowed to use recursion or pointers.
1. Write code to generate random integers (in suitable range). Your output should be in a file. You may use C-library routines or any method (see e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_random_number_generators)    10%
2. Implement insertion sort to sort integers. Your program must read numbers from a file (say that created in 1st problem). You may "hard-code" the file name or any other method you are familiar with (e.g. command line arguments). The number of items can again be either read from terminal/file/command line argument.  20 %
3. Implement heap sort to sort integers. Your program must read numbers from a file (say that created in 1st problem). You may "hard-code" the file name or any other method you are familiar with (e.g. command line arguments). The number of items can again be either read from terminal/file/command line argument. 35 %
4.  Use time command to find running time for programs 2 and 3 for
N=10,100,1000,10000,100 000 (1 lakh), 100 00 00 (1 Million).
Please stop running a program as soon as running time exceeds 3 minutes. 10 %
