### BST & Priority Queues
**Question:**
Use one of following editor (only) to keyin your programs: jed,  xjed, vim, gvim, emacs, xemacs
1. Implement Binary Search Trees. Implement (at least) insert, search, deleteMin and delete. Try to insert 5000 random numbers
one by one. Then traverse the tree in inOrder. Finally, repeatedly find, print and delete the minimum item (for 1000 times)
2. Implement Priority Queues using  r-way heaps. "r" should be a parameter (with r≥2 ≥2 ). Implement (at least) insert, reduceKey and deleteMin. Try to insert 5000 random numbers (same as in Q1) one by one. Carry out deleteMin (and print) for 1000 times.
